        <p class="point-r">
            [1] Size: <span class="about-point">
                Velociraptors were relatively small dinosaurs, measuring about 2 feet (0.6 meters) in height and 6.8 feet (2.1 meters) in length. They were about the size of a turkey.

            [2] Feathers: <span class="about-point">
                Velociraptors were feathered dinosaurs. Fossils have revealed evidence of feathers, suggesting that they were covered in a layer of feathers, which may have served for insulation or display purposes.

        <p class="point-r">
            [4] Carnivorous Diet: <span class="about-point">
                Velociraptors were carnivorous predators, and their diet likely consisted of small vertebrates, such as other dinosaurs or early mammals.

        <p class="point-r">
            [6] Intelligent: <span class="about-point">
                Velociraptors had relatively large brains for dinosaurs, suggesting they were intelligent and may have had complex social behaviors.
